# 0018 - GitHub Actions Locations

* **Status**: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

Where do we store our GitHub action workflow files, and how do we manage these?

## Decision Drivers

* Within DfEâ€™s Technical Guidance
* Developer Readability; is it easy to understand/find/follow where each workflow file is?

## Considered Options

* All pipeline files would be in the folder ```./pipelines```
* All pipeline files would be in the folder ```./.github/workflows/```
* Pipeline files would be in their own separate project folders, e.g. ```./src/project-1/pipelines/``` and ```./src/project-2/pipelines```

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### ./pipelines folder

* Good; keeps the project clean, as all pipeline files are in one place.
* Good; it keeps the project easy to read. It should be immediately obvious to a new developer, looking at the repository, where the pipeline files are.

* Bad; functionally, it is not possible to store *all* workflow files in that directory. [GitHub will only detect files in the ./github/workflows/ folder](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).
  * However, this could be managed by using a parent workflow, in the ```./.github/workflows/``` directory, that includes the various other pipeline files in a ```./pipelines/``` folder. For an example, please see this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/18055#discussioncomment-5793379)

### ./github/workflows

* Good; keeps the project clean, as all pipeline files are in one place.
* Good; this is the way GitHub actions work, so anyone who is familiar with GitHub would understand where they are.

* Bad; it does not match our ideal convention of ```./pipelines```
* Bad; anyone who *isn't* experienced with GitHub might not be able to find these immediately
  * This could be managed by ensuring our documentation is correct, up-to-date, readable, and ensuring it includes information as to where the workflows are.

### Seperate folders per project

* Good; keeps separation of concerns for projects
* Good; if projects are removed/moved from this repository (i.e. we change from a monorepo, to multiple repos), then we would not have to move workflows around

* Bad; all the same negatives as the .```/pipelines``` folder - i.e. this is not natively supported by GitHub

## Decision Outcome

GitHub Workflows must reside within the `.github/workflows` directory as described within the article [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).  

Also it is advised that the reusable Actions are located within the `.github/actions` directory as discussed within the [About custom actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#choosing-a-location-for-your-action) article.
