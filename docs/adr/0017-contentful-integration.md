# 0017 - Contentful Integration

* **Status**: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

There are a variety of ways we could manage integration with Contentful; which method should we use for this project?

## Decision Drivers

* Open source
* Within DfEâ€™s Technical Guidance
* Ease of development
* Extensibility + portability; ideally the functionality we create should, in the future, be able to be shared, and re-used, elsewhere

## Considered Options

* Contentful's existing Nuget package ([contentful.net](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.net))
* Developing our own service(s) to connect to Contentful's HTTP APIs
* Developing our own service(s) to connect to Contentful's REST APIs

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Contentful.net

* Good; functionality already exists, so development should be quicker
* Good; it is open-source, so fits within DfE's technical guidance

* Neutral; it has a lot of functionality that we are unlikely to use (such as their Content Management API).

* Bad; we would want to abstract their implementation, which would require a lot of extra development regardless
* Bad; their implementation uses JSON.Net, which is considered outdated. Modern frameworks tend to use Microsoft's own System.Text.JSON

### Develop own service to access Contentful's HTTP or GraphQL APIs

* Good; Complete freedom to do what we want, and ensure the functionality we develop is exactly what is needed

* Bad; potentially more development time

## Decision Outcome

We are using the contentful.net C# package for our code, as it easily fulfills our requirements for MVS, and is already being used in DFE projects.
