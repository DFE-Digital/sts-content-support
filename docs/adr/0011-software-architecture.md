# 0011 - Software Architecture

* **Status**: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement
What software architecture should be adopted within the PTFYS service to ensure we're following modern and existing DfE standards?

## Decision Drivers
* Within DfEâ€™s Technical Guidance
* SLT Lead Tech (Mamood Suyltan) would like a modern architecture
* Clean Architecture has been used for other DfE Java services

## Considered Options
* Clean Architecture
  * Layer description 
    * UI: MVC application
    * Application: Contains all application logic
    * Domain: Contain all entities, enums, exceptions, interfaces, types and logic specific to the domain layer.
    * Infrastructure: Contains classes for accessing external resources such as file systems, web services, smtp, and so on.

* Clean Architecture with CQRS
  * CQRS
    * Pros
      * Scalability / Optimisation
      * Simplicity & maintainability
    * Cons
      * Increased complexity
      * Not suitable for all applications (e.g. small applications or applications with simple domains)

  * Matt Hewrenze: [clean-architecture-core](https://github.com/matthewrenze/clean-architecture-core)
* Hexagonal Architecture
* Onion Architecture
* Nth Tier Architecture

## Decision Outcome

We have decided to use Clean Architecture in our project. We are not using CQRS as it is unnecessarily complex for the scope of our MVS.
